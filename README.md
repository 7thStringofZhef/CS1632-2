Deliverable Repo

How to build/compile projects:

All deliverables were developed in Eclipse. Files are purposely not put in a package but are instead under default package so that they don't need include statements

Deliverable 2 Build Path:

1.) JUnit4 (this should be among the standard libraries that come with eclipse)
2.) Mockito ("add external jars", mockito-all-1.10.19.jar, which I downloaded at http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-all/1.10.19)

Deliverable 3 Build Path:

1.) All JARs within "selenium-java-2.52.0", which I downloaded at http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
